Assume people can have marital status: single, married, widow, divorced. Create a state OODP (i.e., Java, JavaScript, C++, Python, or Ruby) that deal with people's marital status. You will have at least two classes: Person, and Marital State. Make sure the following rules are followed:

single->married

married-> divorced | widow

divorced -> married 

widow -> married

create a Client class to test your program. Make sure you test valid and invalid change of marital status.
